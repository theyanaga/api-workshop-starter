2. Clone this repo into your local space. And then, inside the new repository, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. After this, run the command `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`. If everything is working properly, if you go to [this url](localhost:8000/api/health), you should see a "Hello World" message!
